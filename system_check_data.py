Bursting with imagery, motion, interaction and distraction though it is, today?s World 
Wide Web is still primarily a conduit for textual information. In HTML5, the focus on writ
ing and authorship is more pronounced than ever. It?s evident in the very way that new el
ements such as article and aside are named. HTML5 asks us to treat the HTML document more as? well, a document.

It?s not just the specifications that are changing, either. Much has been made of permutation
s to Google?s algorithms, which are beginning to favor better written, more authoritative conte
nt (and making work for the growing content strategy industry). Google?s bots are now charged 
                    with asking questions like, ?Was the article edited well, or does it appear sloppy or hastily 
produced?? and ?Does this article provide a complete or comprehensive description of the topic?,?
the sorts of questions one might expect to be posed by an earnest college professor.

This increased support for quality writing, allied with the book-like convenience and tactility o
f smartphones and tablets, means there has never been a better time for reading online. The remainin
  g task is to make the writing itself a joy to read.
